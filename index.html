          <h3>Join Us for International Day of Women and Girls in Science</h3>
          <p>
            International Day for Women and Girls in Science is celebrated every
            year on February 11th to raise awareness about the
            underrepresentation of women in science and to promote gender
            equality in the field of science. This day acknowledges the
            significant contributions that women and girls have made to science,
            while also highlighting the challenges they face in pursuing careers
            in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the progress made in recent years, women and girls continue
            to face various barriers to their participation in science,
            including gender stereotypes, discrimination, lack of
            representation, and insufficient access to resources and
            opportunities. It is essential to recognize the valuable
            contributions of women and girls in science and to promote and
            support their participation in STEM fields...
